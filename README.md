# Unemployment Analysis with Python

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze unemployment trends in India using Python.
This project focuses on understanding the increase in unemployment during the COVID-19
period and comparing unemployment rates between urban and rural areas.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains unemployment data for different regions of India.
It includes the following attributes:
- Date
- Region / State
- Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)
- Estimated Employed
- Labour Participation Rate (%)
- Area (Urban/Rural)

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries.
2. Loaded the unemployment dataset.
3. Performed data cleaning and preprocessing.
4. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA).
5. Visualized unemployment trends over time.
6. Analyzed state-wise unemployment rates.
7. Compared unemployment rates in urban and rural areas.
8. Created correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.

## Results
- Urban areas showed higher unemployment rates compared to rural areas.
- A sharp rise in unemployment was observed during the COVID-19 period.
- Urban unemployment exhibited greater variability than rural unemployment.
- The analysis highlights the economic impact of COVID-19 on employment in India.

## Conclusion
This project provides meaningful insights into unemployment trends in India using
data analysis and visualization techniques. The results help in understanding how
economic disruptions affect employment across different regions.
